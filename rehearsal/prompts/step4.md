Add a QA baseline that gives agents (and later CI) fast, deterministic feedback:

- Angular: Biome as linter and formatter (replaces Prettier).
- C#: .NET code analysis incl. IDE code-style rules (configured in .editorconfig, enforced on build), `dotnet format` as formatter, treat warnings as errors.
- Tests: .NET (unit, integration) and Angular (component, Playwright e2e).
- Helper script in ./scripts that runs the full QA baseline. Output must be easy to consume for an agent: clearly separated sections per tool, pass/fail per section, summary at the end, non-zero exit code on failure. Mention it in tech-docs/testing.md.
- AGENTS.md: at the end of each session that modified code, run the full QA script and fix all issues.
- Make the existing code compliant with the QA baseline.
- Prove that it works: temporarily add typical mistakes to C# and Angular code (lint, formatting, compiler warning), run the script, verify that all issues are detected, then revert them.
- Commit directly to main.
